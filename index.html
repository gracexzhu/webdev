          <p><em>entry-level computer science student at the university of texas at austin</em></p>
          <p>hello! my name is grace, and i am a freshman at the university of texas at austin. unfortunately, 
            life is hard and corona exists, so i'm taking classes from home for the entirety of my freshman year. 
            this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">udemy course</a> lowkey 
            gives me something to do since i'm bored as hell, so i'm not mad at it honestly. outside of school, i like 
            to snowboard, dance, bullet journal, watch tv shows or movies, drink coffee, play valorant, and listen to music. 
            i'm writing this on my first day of creating this personal website, so i really do have some high hopes for how 
            this turns out. i hope it'll be pretty or at least kinda aesthetically pleasing!!!</p></td>
